Once loop is done display total wins total loses and initialize button

Hint:
// choiceButton.on('click', this.checkAnswers.bind(this)); <-- this line from before
// will give you access to BOTH the event (parameter 0) and the game (context variable -> this)
// and then later on you can...


// if you ever need more information on a click event that has been bound
// add the event parameter
checkAnswers: function (event) {
	console.log({
		game: this, // your bound game target
		clickedThing: event.target // the thing you clicked on
	});
	// other code goes here
	// ...
}
